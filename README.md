# MSA_Auth
 A Minimum Viable Product-standard authorization service using a micro-service architecture, with the goal of supporting any future projects I make that require one.

Some of this project is using [Hands-on RESTful Web Services by Packt Publishing](https://www.packtpub.com/product/hands-on-restful-web-services-with-asp-net-core-3/9781789537611) as a base/inspiration.
